// MVC 5's HtmlHelper is a class; ASP.NET Core's IHtmlHelper is an interface, and everything

// edit. The alternative was changing the parameter type in production code, which would
// break the MVC 5 build that still runs the site.

// "no argument given for 'fragment'" on what looks like a perfectly ordinary ActionLink.

// System.Web.Mvc deliberately defines none of those names, so nothing is ambiguous.

// EF Core's enum; `using System.Data.Entity` finds ZkData.Core's shim enum instead, and two
// structurally identical enums are still two types (CS0266).
//
// Scoped here rather than fixed in ZkData.Core: that shim exists because ENTITY code
// compares `entry.State == EntityState.Modified` against ZkDataContext.EntityEntry, whose
// State really is the EF6-shaped type. Both readings are right in their own project, and a
// global alias in this one settles it for linked controllers without touching that.
