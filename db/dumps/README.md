# Put database dumps here

**Nothing in this directory is committed.** `db/.gitignore` excludes it, and it must stay
that way: a dump of the live database contains real accounts - password hashes, e-mail
addresses, IP addresses, private messages - and this repository is public.

Accepted: `.bak` (SQL Server native backup), `.sql` (script dump), or either inside a
`.gz` or `.zip`.

Then:

    docker compose -f db/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ./db/wait-for-db.sh
    ./db/restore.sh

## Getting a dump

The shared folder is at
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18hokFRvN3ylp16tcocv76ilwwqsCr8Ar>. Download it
with a browser - on the it-designers network the command line cannot reach it, the web
filter returns `403 Web Filter Violation` for `drive.google.com`.

## Before sharing a dump onward

A dump taken from live is personal data. If one has to be passed around, strip it first.
The columns that matter, by table:

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `Accounts` | `Password`, `PasswordBcrypt`, `Email`, `Country`, `SteamID`, `InstallID` |
| `AccountIPs` | the whole table |
| `AccountUserIDs` | the whole table |
| `LobbyChatHistory` | private message text |
| `AbuseReports`, `Punishments` | free text about named people |

`ZkData/DbCloner.cs` already knows how to copy a database table by table in
foreign-key order - it is what the live-to-test clone uses, and it is the natural place
to build a redacting export on rather than writing one from scratch.
