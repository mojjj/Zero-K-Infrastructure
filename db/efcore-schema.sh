# Builds a database from the EF Core model and diffs it against the schema the EF6
# migrations produce - the measurement the whole port is steered by.
#
#     ./db/efcore-schema.sh            print the difference
#     ./db/efcore-schema.sh --check    fail if it is not the difference we expect
#     ./db/efcore-schema.sh --update   record the current difference as expected
#
# The difference is not expected to be empty. db/schema/efcore-gap.txt holds what is left
# and says why each part of it is there; --check fails when the gap changes in either
# direction, so closing a gap is as loud as opening one.
#
# The header lines are dropped before comparing: they carry the migration count and the
# name of the latest migration, which change on every migration and have nothing to say
# about whether the two models agree.
