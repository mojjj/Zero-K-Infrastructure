"""
Translates EF6's fluent configuration into EF Core's, generating
ZkData.Core/ZkDataContext.Relationships.cs from ZkData/ZkDataContext.cs.

Why generated rather than typed: there are 139 statements, and EF Core cannot infer these
relationships by itself - two navigations on one entity pointing at the same type are
ambiguous, which is where model building stops. Translating by hand would be 139 chances
to transpose a lambda; translating by rule is one chance to get the rule wrong, and the
rule is visible and re-runnable.

It refuses to guess. Anything it does not recognise is emitted as a compile error rather
than skipped, so an untranslated statement cannot pass quietly.

# What to emit when EF6's configuration says nothing about deletes.
#
# EF6 cascades required relationships by default, and the database it produced does cascade
# 62 of its 163 foreign keys - but reproducing that by assumption creates cascade paths SQL
# Server rejects outright ("may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths"), because EF6's
# migrations settled those cases individually over 117 revisions.
#
# So the default here is deliberately the conservative one, and db/schema/schema.txt is what
# says where it is wrong. The diff names each foreign key that should cascade; those get
# fixed in ZkDataContext.RelationshipsByHand.cs, from evidence rather than from a rule.
