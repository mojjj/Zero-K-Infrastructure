    /// Until an engine was in the loop that was the oldest untested claim in the port -
    /// ZkLobbyServer/PORTABILITY.md carried it as "no entry point of the 135 has been called".

    /// **Skipped unless an engine is present**, so CI stays green without one:
    ///
    ///     ./tools/fetch-engine.sh                       # ~42MB, into the scratch dir it prints
    ///     ZK_DOTNET_MOUNT=&lt;that dir&gt; ./tools/dotnet.sh test Tests.Portable/Tests.Portable.csproj

    /// The engine is deliberately NOT downloaded into the repository: it is 42MB, it is not ours,
    /// and this checkout is synced by Synology Drive, which replicates anything in the tree and
    /// restores it after deletion.
    ///
    /// fetch-engine.sh also installs one small map, because the calls that still hold
    /// System.Drawing.Common - GetMinimap, GetHeightMap, GetMetalMap - do nothing without one.
