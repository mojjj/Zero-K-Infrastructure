    /// P/Invokes against it. tools/native-calls.txt records a verdict for it:
    ///
    ///     Deliberately spelled without an extension, so .NET resolves libunitsync.so on Linux
    ///     and unitsync.dll on Windows.
    ///
    /// **That was an assertion, not a measurement**, and the whole reason this check exists is that
    /// the last unmeasured assumption about a P/Invoke - that kernel32 was fine because it compiled
    /// - cost the server its player port. A DllImport name without an extension is *supposed* to
    /// get the platform's prefix and suffix applied, but nothing here had ever confirmed it for
    /// this name, on this runtime.
    ///
    /// These two tests confirm it without the engine, which is not installed anywhere in CI:
    /// the failure names what was looked for, and a stand-in file with the Linux spelling is
    /// actually found.
    ///
    /// What they do NOT show is that a real libunitsync.so works - that the entry points match,
    /// that the calls marshal, that any of the 135 do what they did on .NET Framework. Only the
    /// engine can answer that. See ZkLobbyServer/PORTABILITY.md.
