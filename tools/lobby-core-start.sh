# ZkLobbyServer.Core proves the chain compiles. That is not the same claim. This runs the program
# against a real database and checks three things a build cannot see:
#
#   1. it refuses when no standalone server is configured - the website would start its own
#   2. it refuses when configured but handed no site directory, naming the GeoIP file it wants
#   3. configured and handed the site directory, it comes up and LISTENS ON BOTH PORTS
#
# (3) is here because of a defect that only running found. TcpTransportServerListener.Bind
# P/Invoked SetHandleInformation out of kernel32; off Windows that throws DllNotFoundException,
# Bind caught it, retried 120 times and gave up - and the server came up with its API listening
# and no player port at all. Nothing was wrong in any log at a glance. Checking that the process
# is alive, or that the API answers, would both have passed. Only the player port shows it.
#
# It costs a couple of minutes: a Whole History Rating pass runs before the listener opens.
