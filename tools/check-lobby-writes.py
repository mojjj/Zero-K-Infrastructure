"""An action that changes the LOBBY SERVER must not be reachable by GET.

    ./tools/check-lobby-writes.py

The third side of the CSRF triangle. tools/check-antiforgery.py reads forms, tools/
check-get-writes.py reads database calls - and between them sits a whole class of state change
that neither can see, because it happens in the other process. check-get-writes.py says so in its
own docstring and has said so since it was written: "this does NOT see an action whose only effect
is on the lobby server". Tourney's JoinBattle and RemoveBattle were found by reading. So was
Planetwars/MatchMakerJoin. Reading is not a check.

What makes this checkable rather than a guess is that the surface is an INTERFACE.
ZkLobbyServer/ILobbyServerApi.cs is the website's entire lobby-server vocabulary - 45 members,
enforced by the port's build, which has no reference to that project. So every member can be
classified once, beside itself:

    [ChangesLobbyState("posts a message")]
    Task GhostSay(Say say, int? battleID = null);

    [ReadsLobbyState]
    bool IsLobbyConnected(string user);

**Both attributes exist so that neither is a default.** A member carrying neither fails this
check until somebody decides which it is, which is the only way a member added next year gets
looked at. Classifying by section comment would not do: `// ---- commands ----` is about the
shape of the call, and OnNewsChanged, AddClanChannel, LogIpFailure and RedeemSessionToken all
change something from under other headings. RedeemSessionToken is the one to remember - it reads
like a query and is single-use, so redeeming invalidates.

An action is reachable by GET unless it carries [HttpPost]. One that calls a changing member must
say which it is, on the method:

    [ChangesLobbyOnGetByDesign("the game client follows this link itself")]
    [ChangesLobbyOnGetNotYetFixed("the chat panel posts through Ajax.BeginForm")]

The second kind is counted and printed every run. A list that shrinks, not a decision.

Calls are matched on the RECEIVER, not on the name alone: `Global.LobbyApi.GhostSay(...)` and
`api?.GhostSay(...)` count, `something_else.GhostSay(...)` does not. check-get-writes.py matches
bare names and pays one false follow for it; here the receiver is always the lobby API, so there
is no reason to be looser than the code is.
