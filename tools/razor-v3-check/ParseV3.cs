// Parses a .cshtml with MVC 5's own Razor, and reports what it rejects.
//
// This repository has said from the beginning that nothing here can check an MVC 5 view - mono
// ships no aspnet_compiler.exe - and has therefore treated every view edit as unverifiable on
// the Framework side. That is true of COMPILATION. It is not true of SYNTAX: System.Web.Razor
// 3.2.3 is in the NuGet cache the mono build already restores, and its parser will say whether
// Razor v3 accepts a construct.
//
// That is exactly the question a view edit raises. @helper exists in v3 and not in ASP.NET Core;
// a templated Razor delegate may exist in both. Guessing which is what this tool removes.
//
// What it does NOT do is bind names or types. `@await Component.InvokeAsync("X")` parses here
// perfectly happily - it is syntactically fine and would fail to COMPILE, which this never sees.
// It answers "is this Razor v3 syntax?", not "does this build?". That is still worth having,
// because it is what separates @helper from a construct both stacks accept, and it caught a
// nested @{ } that ASP.NET Core's parser tolerates and Razor v3 rejects.
