# Builds with msbuild under mono in Docker. It is the only way to know whether a change
# compiles without a Windows machine, and it is what every modernization change in this
# repository has been checked with. The argument is any msbuild project; CI passes
# tools/mono-buildable.proj, which names the sixteen of the solution's twenty projects
# that mono can build - Zero-K.sln itself cannot be used, because the other four are WPF.
#
# Works on a copy of the tracked files, so the repository never collects root-owned obj/
# and packages/ directories from the container.
#
# What it CANNOT do, and why the Windows build still matters:
#   * Razor views are not compiled. mono ships no aspnet_compiler.exe (MSB6004), so a
#     mistake in a .cshtml file gets through this check untouched.
#   * It does not run anything. Running the site needs Windows, IIS Express and a database.
#   * It does not publish, so on its own it cannot catch a project item that names a file
#     which is not there. The guard below does that part, because the Windows build does.

#     Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets(3074,5): error : Copying file Views\...\X.cshtml failed
#
# Deleting a dead view and forgetting its csproj line passed here and failed there. This runs

# When the argument is tools/mono-buildable.proj it checks each project that file lists, not
# the .proj itself - which names no files of its own, so checking it alone would check nothing
# and pass. That is not hypothetical: moving CI onto the .proj did exactly that for one commit,
# and took a 314-item guard down to 0 without failing.
