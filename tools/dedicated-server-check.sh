# tools/lobby-core-start.sh takes the lobby server as far as OpenBattle, which announces a battle
# without starting anything. This is the step after: DedicatedServer.HostGame - the method
# ZkLobbyServer calls when a battle actually starts - generating a script, resolving the binary
# through SpringPaths, and launching spring-dedicated.
#
# What it needs, and why so little: an engine (~42MB) and a map (~333KB), both from the projects'
# own distribution via tools/fetch-engine.sh, plus a six-line game archive written here. A Spring
# DEDICATED server relays the game rather than simulating it, but it still resolves and hashes both
# archives, so a game is required - just not a real one. That is what keeps this out of
# multi-gigabyte territory.
#
# Skipped, not failed, when no engine is present: CI has none.
