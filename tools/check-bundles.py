"""The two copies of the bundle list must agree.

    ./tools/check-bundles.py

Zero-K.info/App_Start/BundleConfig.cs is what the live site serves. It is written against
System.Web.Optimization's BundleCollection, which does not exist on .NET 9, so the port cannot
link it and ZeroKWeb.Core/Mvc5Compat/BundlingCompat.cs carries a second copy of the same list.

BundlingCompat's own comment said "the check in ZeroKWeb.Host compares the two". It did not:
nothing anywhere compared them, and the only two files mentioning ~/bundles/main were the two
lists. This is that check, written.

It matters because drift is silent in both directions. A script added to the site and not to the
port makes the ported pages quietly miss it; one removed from the site and left in the port makes
the port render a tag for a file that is gone - and the host harness asserts only that the bundle
renders SOMETHING, so neither shows up as a failure.
