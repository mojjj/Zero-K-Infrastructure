#
# The views had never been compiled by anything in this repository: mono ships no
# aspnet_compiler.exe, so tools/build-website.sh covers C# only. This turns "117 views,
# condition unknown" into a number.
#
# It measures compilation, NOT rendering. A view that compiles can still throw on the first
# request, and none of these has been rendered by anything.
#
# WHY IT COMPILES MORE THAN ONCE. Roslyn does not bind method bodies at all if the
# compilation has a declaration-level error. One build of all 116 views has 66 of them - a
# view whose @model type is missing is a broken field declaration - so NO view's body is ever
# bound, and every body-level mistake in the other 50 goes unreported. A report reads that
# silence as "compiles". The first version of this script did exactly that, and a view
# rewritten to call ThisTypeDoesNotExistAnywhere sat in its "37 clean" without a murmur.
#
# It is not an error-budget effect, which is what this comment used to claim. Two views are
# enough: _ViewStart.cshtml alone reports its two CS1061s, and adding one view with a missing
# @model type makes both disappear.
#
# So: one build of everything, which reliably yields the Razor diagnostics and the
# declaration-level ones, then a second pass over only the views that came back clean - a set
# with no declaration errors in it by construction, so bodies are bound and body errors are
# reported. Batches keep the blast radius small if that assumption ever fails: a batch that
# turns out to contain a declaration error is re-run one view at a time.

# ZeroKWeb.Core cannot normally answer that. Its views carry declaration errors, so Roslyn binds
# no method body in the project - including the bodies of every linked controller. A controller
# with a CS0103 in a method still DECLARES its type, so a view's @model binds and the view is
# reported as compiling, while ZeroKWeb.Render - which holds only working views, and therefore
# binds bodies - cannot build at all.
#
# That is not hypothetical: four controllers were linked on the strength of a clean ZeroKWeb.Core
# build and three of them did not compile. Building with NO views removes the declaration errors
# and makes the linked C# report itself.
#
# CS5001 is expected and ignored: with no views there is no generated entry point.
