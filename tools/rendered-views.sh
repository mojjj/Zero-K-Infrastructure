# Which Razor views actually RENDER when the host harness runs?
#
#     ./tools/rendered-views.sh            the count, and what never renders
#
# 122 views compile, and tools/view-port-report.sh checks that. This asks the other question, and
# they are not the same one: News/Index.cshtml compiled for weeks and threw on its first request.
#
# The host records every view Razor executes when ZK_RENDERED_VIEWS names a file - see
# RenderedViewRecorder in ZeroKWeb.Host/Program.cs. This runs the harness with it set and diffs the
# result against the tracked .cshtml files.
#
# It measures the harness, which runs with NO lobby server attached - deliberately, because the
# site has to render without one. A view whose ACTION asks Global.LobbyApi before choosing one
# cannot be reached that way at all, and would read here as uncovered when it is simply covered
# somewhere else. Measured, two are like that: Planetwars/PwMatchMaker and Tourney/TourneyIndex.
#
# So tools/stack.sh now records what IT rendered, and the list below is annotated from that file
# when it is there. The three Lobby/LobbyChat views are NOT in it - having a lobby server is not
# enough for those - which is the sort of thing a hardcoded "these are fine" list would have got
# wrong in the flattering direction.
#
# **A view in the "never rendered" list is not broken.** Most render perfectly well when something
# asks for them; /Home, /Forum and /Clans did, which is how they came to be in the harness at all.
# The list is a coverage measurement, not a defect report.
