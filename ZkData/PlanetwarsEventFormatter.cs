    /// was the website reaching into the lobby server; this was the lobby server reaching into the
    /// WEBSITE - `IPlanetwarsEventCreator` was implemented once, in Zero-K.info, and it formats the
    /// event feed's HTML. The server calls it from 19 places, so a lobby server in its own process
    /// could not write an event at all.
    ///
    /// Two things were needed and are now parameters rather than ambients:
    ///
    /// - <see cref="ZkHtmlContext"/> - who is looking and how to build a URL. The website passes
    ///   its per-request one, so its events are formatted exactly as before; a standalone server
    ///   passes one built from GlobalConst.BaseSiteUrl, because it has no request.
    /// - <paramref name="say"/> - how to tell a clan or faction channel about the event. In the
    ///   website that was Global.LobbyApi.GhostSay; in the server it is the server itself.
    ///
    /// The body was moved by extraction, not retyped. What it does is unchanged, including the
    /// part that is arguably wrong: an event's HTML is rendered once, at creation, so a colour
    /// that depends on the viewer is baked in for everyone who reads the feed afterwards. That is
    /// today's behaviour and this is not the change that should alter it.
