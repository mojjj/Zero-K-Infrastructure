    /// stop needing WCF.
    ///
    /// **Why this exists.** Server-side WCF has no in-box successor on .NET 9, and
    /// `MissionService.svc` is one of the two endpoints that made the port's WCF step
    /// "could not be carried out as written". Unlike `ContentService.svc`, whose remaining callers
    /// are clients deployed years ago and can only be identified from production logs, both ends
    /// of this one are in this repository - so it can move without waiting for anyone.
    ///
    /// **The contract does not change, only the envelope.** `Mission` is `[DataContract]` with
    /// explicit `[DataMember]` fields, and Json.NET honours that, so exactly the same fields cross
    /// as under WCF - navigations the entity carries are not among them, then or now.
    /// `MissionSlot` and `Mod` are `[Serializable]` with public fields only, which both
    /// serialisers treat the same way. MissionServiceRoundTripTests checks that rather than
    /// trusting it.
    ///
    /// The shape - an ApiRequest/ApiResponse pair per operation, dispatched by class name through
    /// CommandJsonSerializer - is the one `/ContentService` already uses. A second convention for
    /// the same job would be worse than either.
    /// </summary>
    /// <summary>
    /// The message types, listed rather than discovered.
    ///
    /// `Utils.GetAllTypesWithAttribute` scans the attribute's own assembly plus the entry,
    /// executing and calling ones - which is why `/ContentService`'s messages work: they live in
    /// PlasmaShared, where the attribute is. These cannot: they carry `Mission`, and PlasmaShared
    /// is built before ZkData and cannot reference it.
    ///
    /// So whoever builds a serializer for these adds them. Getting that wrong is not subtle - the
    /// serializer answers "Invalid json type" and nothing moves at all.
